# Stencil-Tasks

A collection of utility tasks to make StencilJS development easier.

## Installing
Currently this is only designed to be included in [stencil-boilerplate](https://github.com/Beclamide/stenciljs-boilerplate) however I might publish it on NPM if there's interest.

## Tasks

### --create
Creates a new component with SASS file and test.

```
$ npm run task --create component_name
```

Where `component_name` is the name of the new component you would like to create.
